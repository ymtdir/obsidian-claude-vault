# Obsidian Vault — Claude Code Rules

Respond in Japanese.

## Vault structure

| Folder | Role | Filename convention | Link strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `00_INBOX/` | Drop zone for source material such as clipped articles and reading notes. Left unorganized | Free (a name that conveys the content) | Not needed |
| `10_WIKI/` | Research/learning notes. Stored flat without subfolders | A name that concisely expresses the topic | Actively connect notes with `[[wikilink]]` |
| `20_DAILY/` | Daily notes | `YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Link from learnings/insights to `10_WIKI/` |
| `30_DOCUMENTS/` | General-purpose shared documents. No linking needed since they are output externally | Free | Do not insert links |
| `40_TRANSLATIONS/` | Translation/summary notes of foreign articles created by `/translating-articles` | Japanese translation of the original article title | Do not insert links |
| `50_ARTICLES/` | Technical articles written with `/writing-articles`. Past articles accumulate too | A name that concisely expresses the article title | Do not insert links |
| `70_PERSONAL/` | Personal information around the user. Outside git management | A name that expresses the purpose | Not needed |
| `90_ARCHIVES/` | Place to move source material already ingested by `/ingesting-inbox` | The original filename as is | Not needed |
| `98_TEMPLATES/` | Storage for Obsidian template files | A name that expresses the purpose | Not needed |
| `99_ASSETS/` | Assets such as images | — | — |

## Zettelkasten principles

- **1 note = 1 idea**: each note in `10_WIKI/` covers a single topic
- **Connect with links**: connect notes with `[[wikilink]]`. Links — not tags or folders — create the structure
- **Autonomy**: write each note so it makes sense when read on its own

## Note creation rules

- Do not use Obsidian properties (YAML frontmatter)
- Since the filename becomes the title, a `# heading` is unnecessary in `10_WIKI/`. Start headings from `##`, and use `###` for sub-divisions under it
- Embed `[[wikilink]]`s to related notes naturally into the context of the body (do not collect them in an end-of-note list)

## Referencing personal information

Base answers to the user on the personal information under `70_PERSONAL/` (the user themselves, their relationships, etc.). Whenever a potentially relevant topic comes up — in a question, a consultation, or small talk — check the corresponding note with Grep / Read. Reference it actively in the context of life advice and decision-making. Since `70_PERSONAL/` is outside git management, do not mix its contents into commits or public output.

## Operational commands / skills

Keep the details of operational procedures within each skill. This file defines only the "map" of the vault.
